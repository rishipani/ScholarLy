ScholarLy, Because Managing Schools Shouldn’t Feel Like Rocket Science
Track students, attendance, and marks… all without losing your sanity (hopefully).

ScholarLy – For Admins Who Like Less Paper, More Screens.

Managing schools the modern way: dashboards, notifications, and no more “Where’s my attendance sheet?” panic.

ScholarLy – For Students and peeps who are sick of Current ERP School App.

Kotlin + Android = finally a school app that pretends it knows what it’s doing.
